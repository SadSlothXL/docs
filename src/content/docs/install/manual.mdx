## Manual installation

If you run into issues with the IW4x Launcher or use an older Windows version you can manually install IW4x.

You __don't__ have to do this if you followed the [Launcher installation instructions](/install/windows-launcher)!

#### 1. Download [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_2009/)
Find Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - Multiplayer in your Steam library, click each and select `Install`. Wait for the downloads to finish before you continue!

#### 2. Download the IW4x Client __and__ Rawfiles

  <LinkButton
    href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client/releases/latest/download/iw4x.dll"
    variant="primary"
    icon="download"
    iconPlacement="start"
  >
    Client

  <LinkButton
    href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/release.zip"
    variant="primary"
    icon="download"
    iconPlacement="start"
  >
    Rawfiles
  </LinkButton>

#### 3. Locate your Game folder

#### 4. Manually install IW4x

Move the downloaded `iw4x.dll` into the game folder.  
Extract the contents of `release.zip` into the game folder.

Your folder should look similiar to this:
<FileTree>
- iw4x/
- main/
- miles/
- userraw/
- zone/
- binkw32.dll
- iw4mp.exe
- iw4sp.exe
- iw4x.dll
- iw4x.exe
- mss32.dll
- zonebuilder.exe
</FileTree>

#### 5. Run `iw4x.exe`
Double-click `iw4x.exe` to start the game!

:::note
If you are on Linux add `iw4x.exe` as a Non-Steam game in your Steam Library for best performance, you can try different Proton versions to see which works best for you.
