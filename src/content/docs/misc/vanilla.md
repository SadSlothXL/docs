IW4x contains various changes and tweaks, this guide will list DVars that allow you to disable some of them.  
By far not everything is togglable (yet), but we are working on it!  

### Vanilla DVars

| DVar | Default Value | Vanilla | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `bg_refill_grenade_launcher_with_onemanarmy` | `0` | `1` | Setting this DVar to 1 allows to restore the vanilla mechanic of refilling grenade launcher ammunition with the One Man Army perk |
| `bg_replace_painkiller_with_adrenaline` | `1` | `0` | Setting this DVar to 0 restores the vanilla Painkiller deathstreak perk that reduces damage taken for the perk's duration |
