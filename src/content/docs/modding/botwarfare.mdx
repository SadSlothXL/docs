## Introduction

This guide will teach you how to install the [Bot Warfare](https://github.com/ineedbots/iw4_bot_warfare) mod by [INeedGames](https://ineedbots.github.io/).

Bot Warfare can be installed as either **always loaded scripts** or as a **mod that has to be loaded explicitly**.

### Installation Types

**Script Installation:**
- Uses your default stats
- Gets loaded automatically when starting a private match or server
- Does **not** require a player to download the mod when connecting

**Mod Installation:**
- Uses its own stats file (everyone starts at rank 1)
- Has to be loaded explicitly from the mod list
- Other players need to download the mod to join your game
